  // Description:
  // - A binary brush creates black and white drawings
  // - A Grayscale brush creates a gaussian profile (actually a ramp) like drawing.
  // - A label brush creates a label map, each stroke can represent any one label.
  //
  // The brush you choose depends on what your intent is. 
  // - If your drawing has just one segmentation (one label), you are better 
  //   off using a binary brush. You will be editing with voxel precision.
  // - If you wish to render your segmentation as contours and be able to edit
  //   with sub-voxel precision, use the grayscale brush.
  // - If your drawing has several segmentations, you would be better off using
  //   a Label brush. You will be editing with voxel precision. Note that you 
  //   can still edit multiple segmentations with several binary brushes, but
  //   its in the interest of memory not to do so.
